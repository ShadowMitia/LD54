# Description

You achieved your dream of opening a bakery! Except its in a truly teeny tiny shop, where you barely have enough space to squeeze into! Customers are waiting on your cakes! Get moving!

A chill game where you have to make cakes for customers. The challenge is in the tiny space where you have to operate.

# Commands

Just use the arrow keys!
